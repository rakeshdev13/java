'''Programming Language:
A programming language is a formal system used to communicate instructions to a computer.
It consists of a set of syntax rules and semantics that enable developers to write programs that a computer can understand and execute.
These languages allow humans to create software, control hardware, process data, and perform other tasks.

3)LIST                                   TUPLE
* LIST denoted by []                     Tuple is denoted by ()
*List is collection of MTD               Tupleis collection of MTD
*It allows duplicates                    *It allows duplicates
*It's mutable                             *It's immutable
*List is ordered and indexed              *List is ordered and indexed

 4)mylist = [1, 2, 3, "apple"]
Functionalities:
Access elements via indexing (my_list[0])
Modify elements (my_list[1] = "banana")
Add elements using .append(), .insert()
Remove elements using .remove(), .pop(), .clear()
Sorting with .sort() and reversing with .reverse()
List slicing (my_list[1:3])
List comprehensions


5)mytuple = (1, 2, 3, "apple")
Functionalities:
Access elements via indexing (my_tuple[0])
Iterate over tuple elements
Can be used for multiple assignments (a, b = (1, 2))
Tuple unpacking

6)my_set = {1, 2, 3, "apple"}
Functionalities:
Add elements with .add()
Remove elements with .remove(), .discard()'''
